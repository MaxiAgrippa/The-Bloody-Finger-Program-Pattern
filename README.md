# The-Bloody-Finger-Program-Pattern
The most popular, powerful, fast, incredible robust and flexible program pattern

Follow design principles are critical for you to become a successful program designer, system designer, coder, project manager, coder, manager, project lifesaver, and a real lifesaver if you want.

Principles:
1. There is no such thing called design pattern or design in programming. You will be the one and the only one in the group who is actually working. Others just keep talking shit, doing nothing and call you the extreme go-house. 

2. Extreme go-house is real. They are dedicating their personal safity in order to save the entire program by using heuristic design and research pattern and do it FAST!!!

3. If you are reading this line, you are doing too much reading. A good programmer is borned, not created. Start you code right now and prove yourself to the world that who you really are.

4. If you read principle 4th after read principle 3th, you are hopeless. Pls, be a real lifesaver.

5.
